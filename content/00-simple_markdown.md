## How to organize the preprint content? 

NeuroLibre expects all the preprint content (except for `paper.md` and `preprint.md`) under 
the `content` folder. You can add subfolders to organize your content as you see fit.

The `_toc.yml` file determines the structure of your Book. Please visit the [official documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html) for details.

## How to configure Book settings?

The `_config.yml` defines the majority Book configurations. Please visit the [official documentation]9https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html?highlight=_config%20yml) for details.
